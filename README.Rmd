# New Zealand COVID-19 Vaccination data

This repository contains data from the Ministry of Health, available here:

https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-data-and-statistics/covid-19-vaccine-data

Each week there is a new spreadsheet, and this repository contains them all for your convenience, as the website only provides the current sheet.

In addition, population baselines are available as well, from Statistics NZ.

The data are raw, as provided by the Ministry. They are not consistent. You will need to do some data munging to get them to line up.

Some (not particularly nice) data wrangling code is in `vacc_by_age_gender_ethnicity.R` which also produces a chart of vaccination progress using `ggplot2`.
